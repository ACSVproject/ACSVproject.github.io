	<i> We explain a discontinuous drop in the exponential growth rate for certain multivariate generating functions at a critical parameter value, in even dimensions at least 4. This result depends on computations in the homology of the algebraic variety where the generating function has a pole. These computations are similar to, and inspired by, a thread of research in applications of complex algebraic geometry to hyperbolic PDEs, going back to Leray, Petrowski, Atiyah, Bott and Garding. As a consequence, we give a topological explanation for certain asymptotic phenomenon appearing in the combinatorics and number theory literature. Furthermore, we show how to combine topological methods with symbolic algebraic computation to determine explicitly the dominant asymptotics for such multivariate generating functions. This in turn enables the rigorous determination of integer coefficients in the Morse-Smale complex, which are difficult to determine using direct geometric methods. </i>

	<i> Let F be the quotient of an analytic function with a product of linear functions. Working in the framework of analytic combinatorics in several variables, we compute asymptotic formulae for the Taylor coefficients of F using multivariate residues and saddle-point approximations. Because the singular set of F is the union of hyperplanes, we are able to make explicit the topological decompositions which arise in the multivariate singularity analysis. In addition to effective and explicit asymptotic results, we provide the first results on transitions between different asymptotic regimes, and provide the first software package to verify and compute asymptotics in non-smooth cases of analytic combinatorics in several variables. It is also our hope that this paper will serve as an entry to the more advanced corners of analytic combinatorics in several variables for combinatorialists. </i>

	<i> This subsumes the results in the earlier conference paper (ISSAC 2016). The coefficient sequences of multivariate rational functions appear in many areas of combinatorics. Their diagonal coefficient sequences enjoy nice arithmetic and asymptotic properties, and the field of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) makes it possible to compute asymptotic expansions. We consider these methods from the point of view of effectivity. In particular, given a rational function, ACSV requires one to determine a (generically) finite collection of points that are called critical and minimal. Criticality is an algebraic condition, meaning it is well treated by classical methods in computer algebra, while minimality is a semi-algebraic condition describing points on the boundary of the domain of convergence of a multivariate power series. We show how to obtain dominant asymptotics for the diagonal coefficient sequence of multivariate rational functions under some genericity assumptions using symbolic-numeric techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first completely automatic treatment and complexity analysis for the asymptotic enumeration of rational functions in an arbitrary number of variables. </i>

	<i> In this paper, we use the multivariate analytic techniques of Pemantle and Wilson to derive asymptotic formulae for the coefficients of a broad class of multivariate generat- ing functions with algebraic singularities. Then, we apply these results to a generating function encoding information about the stationary distributions of a graph coloring algorithm studied by Butler, Chung, Cummings, and Graham (2015). Historically, Flajolet and Odlyzko (1990) analyzed the coefficients of a class of univariate generating functions with algebraic singularities. These results have been extended to classes of multivariate generating functions by Gao and Richmond (1992) and Hwang (1996, 1998), in both cases by immediately reducing the multivariate case to the univariate case. Pemantle and Wilson (2013) outlined new multivariate analytic techniques and used them to analyze the coefficients of rational generating functions. These multivariate techniques are used here to analyze functions with algebraic singularities. </i>

	<i> We consider a bivariate rational generating function $F(x,y) = P(x,y)/Q(x,y) = \sum_{r,s} a_{r,s} x^r y^s$ under the assumption that the complex algebraic curve on which $Q$ vanishes is smooth. Formulae for the asymptotics of the coefficients $a_{r,s}$ were derived by Pemantle and Wilson (2002). These formulae are in terms of algebraic and topological invariants of the pole variety, but up to now these invariants could be computed only under a minimality hypothesis, namely that the dominant saddle lies on the boundary of the domain of convergence. In the present paper, we give an effective method for computing the topological invariants, and hence the asymptotics of the values $a_{r,s}$, without the minimality assumption. This leads to a theoretically rigorous algorithm, whose implementation is in progress. </i>

We derive asymptotics for the coefficients $F_{r\alpha}$ as $r\rightarrow\infty$ with $r\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^d$ for $alpha$ in a permissible subset of d-tuples of positive reals. More specifically, we give an algorithm for computing arbitrary terms of the asymptotic expansion for $F_{r\alpha}$ when the asymptotics are controlled by a transverse multiple point of the analytic variety $H = 0$.

	<i> The multivariate singularity analysis of Pemantle and Wilson is explored and then used to derive an asymptotic expression for the number of bicolored supertrees, realized as the diagonal sequence of a bivariate rational function $F$. These asymptotics have been obtained previously by univariate methods, but the analysis contained herein serves as a case study for the general multivariate method. The analysis itself relies heavily on the structure of a height function $h$ along the pole set $V$ of $F$. What makes this example interesting is the geometry of $h$ on $V$, namely that h has a degenerate saddle point away from the boundary of the domain of analyticity of F that contributes to the asymptotic analysis. Due to the geometry of h at this point, the coefficient analysis can not be computed directly from the standard formulas of multivariate singularity analysis. Performing the analysis in this case represents a first step towards understanding general cases of this geometric type. </i>

	<i> Asymptotics for smooth points are computed in the above articles by Fourier-Laplace integrals, and are usually uniform for most sets of directions. However there can be directions where the asymptotic behaviour changes (for example, in &#39;Airy phenomena&#39; where $ r^{-1/2} $ becomes $ r^{-1/3} $) and uniformity breaks down. The thesis studies such situations in detail in the two-dimensional case. It relies on the asymptotic analysis of a certain type of &#39;parameter-varying&#39; F-L integral of the form $ \int \exp(-sP(d,x))A(d,x) dx $. The cases of interest are when either the phase term $P(d,x)$ or the amplitude term $A(d,x)$ exhibits a change of degree as $d$ approaches a degenerate direction. These are handled by a generalized version of the stationary phase and the coalescing saddle point method. Uniform expansions and local limit results are obtained. </i>
